ACT = f"""
Produce the next action to be performed with the current page.
If the task is already solved, produce final_answer_action and stop.
You can interact with the page elements using their BIDs as arguments for actions.
Be very cautious. Avoid submitting anything before verifying the effect of your
actions. Take the time to explore the effect of safe actions using reasoning first. For example
you can fill a few elements of a form, but don't click submit before verifying
that everything was filled correctly.
